# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
SQL, Postgres, PGAdmin

## Overview

A Human Resources analyst with Pewlett Hackard, a large, long-standing company, approached us
to lead the creation of the company's new Human Resources database, and to assist with the analysis
of the company's upcoming "silver tsunami"; as Baby Boomer's reach retirement age, the company needs
to identify the number of employees retiring in the near future, and determine the number of 
positions that need to be filled within the company. For the creation of the HR database, we were 
tasked with moving data from CSVs created in Excel into a SQL database, in this case using PostgreSQL 
through pgAdmin, and then creating SQL queries to perform our retirement analysis. 


## Results

- Pewlett Hackard has quite the retirement crunch ahead of them, with over 90,000 employees identified
as nearing retirement age. These positions will most likely need to be filled, while management may 
also need to decide whether certain positions can be consolidated, or replaced by automation. 
![Number of Retiring Employees: 90,398](

- The Engineering ranks at Pewlett Hackard stand to be the most hard hit by the upcoming retirements.
Between Senior Engineers, Engineers, and Assistant Engineers, over 45,000 employees will be retiring 
imminently. 
![Number of Engineering Positions Retiring: 45,000+](

- Pewlett Hackard's Management ranks are mostly unaffected, with only two managers up for retirement. 

- The planned mentorship program may be inadequate for the number of positions retiring. Only 1,549 
employees fit the initial criteria for the mentorship program. If the full number of retiring 
employees are replaced, that would leave the average mentor responsible for over 58 incoming employees. 
![Employees Eligible for Mentorship Program: 1549](
